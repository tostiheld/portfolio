# Road+

Road+ was a group effort to create a concept of a safer traffic 
environment. It consists of 3 modules created by 5 people. 
I focused mostly on the server module but helped on the other modules
as well. Even though I did in fact NOT create all 3 modules myself, they are
include for completeness sake.
