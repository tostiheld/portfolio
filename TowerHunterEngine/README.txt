Needed components to make this game run:
  - 1 Lego EV3 robot equipped with an HiTechnic Color sensor, a gyro, and two servos
  - 1 XBOX360 gamepad

Steps to follow:

  1. Connect the beamer to a computer, as well as the gamepad and optionally the bluetooth adapter
  2. Specify in the configuration file where the topleft corner is of the beamer.
     (this is usually the X component of your computer's resolution and a zero,
	  so for example (1280, 0))
  3. Pair the computer and the EV3
  4. Place the EV3 on the perspex surface
  5. Start the game
  6. Start the special software on the EV3
